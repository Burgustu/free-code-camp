Two answers to this one. Easy peasy ES6 answer:

function end(str, target) {
  return str.endsWith(target)
}
  end("The cow jumped over the moon","moon");

*/

//I felt like this was kind of too easy, redid it with substr

function end(str, target) {
  var lastLetter = str.substr(-target.length);
  var compareLetter = target;
  
if (lastLetter === compareLetter) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
 
  return lastLetter;
}

end("He has to give me a new name", "e");
